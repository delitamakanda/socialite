###### NOISEMAKER -One Dream One Roof

Socialite is my flask application. I want to share with the world my passion for *code*. I realized this app with the help [Miguel Grinberg's blog](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/). I want to discover flask micro framework and others alternatives to Django. Flask is very easy to scale not as Django is. And I try to keep this project maintain with new features soon. You can contact me, i also love to read from others challenges, projects, jobs, etc...
